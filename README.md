# Learning Node JS

  This repo was created to store the development of a Node project following the classes from Rocketseat Bootacamp.

  The course wasn't finished, since I had to stop the theories to start the practices in the real world of my job, so there is not much to see, just the basic of creating a Node project with Express, Postgress and Sequelize. 
  
  This repo is organized by branchs, each branch is a module of the course.
